# Matrix Authentication Service

MAS (Matrix Authentication Service) is a user management and authentication service for [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) homeservers, written and maintained by [Element](https://element.io/). You can directly run and manage the source code in this repository, available under an AGPL license (or alternatively under a commercial license from Element). Support is not provided by Element unless you have a subscription.

It has been created to support the migration of Matrix to a next-generation of auth APIs per [MSC3861](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3861).

See the [Documentation](https://element-hq.github.io/matrix-authentication-service/index.html) for information on installation and use.

## 🚀 Getting started

This component is developed and maintained by [Element](https://element.io). It gets shipped as part of the **Element Server Suite (ESS)** which provides the official means of deployment.

ESS is a Matrix distribution from Element with focus on quality and ease of use. It ships a full Matrix stack tailored to the respective use case.

There are three editions of ESS:

- [ESS Community](https://github.com/element-hq/ess-helm) - the free Matrix
  distribution from Element tailored to small-/mid-scale, non-commercial
  community use cases
- [ESS Pro](https://element.io/server-suite) - the commercial Matrix
  distribution from Element for professional use
- [ESS TI-M](https://element.io/server-suite/ti-messenger) - a special version
  of ESS Pro focused on the requirements of TI-Messenger Pro and ePA as
  specified by the German National Digital Health Agency Gematik
